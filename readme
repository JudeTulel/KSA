# Maritime Surveillance using YOLOv5
## Overview
- This project aims to combat illegal maritime fishing on the Kenyan Coast using a YOLOv5 model trained on a comprehensive dataset of maritime satellite images. The solution leverages the ShipRSImageNet dataset, which includes high-resolution optical remote sensing images with fine-grained annotations of various ship types.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is the ShipRSImageNet dataset, which was first presented by Z. Zhang, L. Zhang, Y. Wang, P. Feng, and R. He in their paper "ShipRSImageNet: A Large-Scale Fine-Grained Dataset for Ship Detection in High-Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Images," published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, vol. 14, pp. 8458-8472, 2021.

## Key Features:
- Images: Around 930x930 pixels each.
- Annotations: Contains ships with different scales, orientations, and aspect ratios.
- Categories: 50 object categories with 17,573 ship instances.
## Setup
- Prerequisites
  - Python 3.x
  - PyTorch
  - CUDA (for GPU support)
